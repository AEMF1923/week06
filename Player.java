i.	Fields
1.	hand (List of Card)--referring back to card?
2.	score (set to 0 in the constructor)
3.	name
ii.	Methods
1.	describe (prints out information about the player and calls the describe method for each card in the Hand List)
2.	flip (removes and returns the top card of the Hand)
3.	draw (takes a Deck as an argument and calls the draw method on the deck, adding the returned Card to the hand field)
4.	incrementScore (adds 1 to the Playerâ€™s score field)
